# Timesheet


Implement new page which allows user to enter time logs for the tasks he/she has done.

\- User needs to select task (using autocomplete/typeahead preferably) and enter start and end date and time.

\- Bonus task (if time allows): User should be able to see the logs he/she has entered.
